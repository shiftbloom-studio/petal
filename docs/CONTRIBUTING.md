# Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. Bugs and feature requests are opened as
[issues](https://github.com/shiftbloom-studio/petal/issues/new/choose), and questions and ideas go
to [Discussions](https://github.com/shiftbloom-studio/petal/discussions). A security problem goes
by mail to the address in the [imprint](https://petal.shiftbloom.studio/imprint), not into a public
issue.

This page covers the development workflow and the rules a change has to follow. For how the code
fits together, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Setup

Requirements: Node.js 24 or newer (`.node-version`) and pnpm, at the version pinned in
`package.json` under `packageManager`.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dev server runs on plain Node and prints its URL. Open `/` for the start page or
`/chat/<channel>` for the overlay. No Cloudflare tooling is needed or installed. The relay and the
gateway only exist on Cloudflare: the dev server answers `/api/` with 503, so an overlay in
development uses its direct connections to Twitch and the providers.

The first `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build` downloads Clash Display and General Sans from Fontshare into
`public/fonts/fontshare/`. The folder is git-ignored because the fonts' license does not allow
republishing them. If the download fails, the pages fall back to system fonts.

| Script           | What it does                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`       | Start the dev server with HMR                         |
| `pnpm build`     | Production build for Cloudflare Workers, in `.output/` |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-check the app and, separately, `src/worker`      |
| `pnpm lint`      | Lint and check formatting with Biome                  |
| `pnpm format`    | Apply Biome formatting and safe fixes                 |
| `pnpm test`      | Run the unit tests in `test/`                         |
| `pnpm seo`       | Rewrite `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt` and `sitemap.xml` in `public/` |
| `pnpm og`        | Render the images of a shared link into `public/`, then `pnpm seo` |
| `pnpm check`     | `typecheck`, `lint` and `test`: run before pushing    |

There is no local preview of the built Worker and no preview deployment of a branch. Use the dev
server while working, and run the built Worker in local workerd with the end-to-end suite to try
the real deployment. The end-to-end suite of the relay and
the smoke test in `scripts/e2e/` are run by hand. The suite (`run.mjs`) needs a Wrangler binary
from outside the project; the smoke test (`smoke-live.mjs`) needs a running Petal, local or
deployed, and no Wrangler. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#testing-the-relay).

## Tests

The suite is kept small on purpose: test code stays at no more than a tenth of the other code. It
covers what would take chat down or send data to the wrong place: IRC parsing, the chat transport
and its fallback, the chat session and the client of the data gateway, the options of an overlay
link, the relay and the data gateway (`test/worker/`, which also reads `wrangler.jsonc`), the files
the start page gives search engines (`test/seo.test.ts`), the theme rules and the bot check. They
run offline: WebSockets are replaced by a fake (`FakeWebSocket`) and `fetch` answers from a table
(`stubFetch`), both in `test/helpers.ts`. The relay's tests bring fakes of their own, a clock and
Twitch among them, in `test/worker/relay/fakes.ts`.

A bug fix does not need a new test. Add one only where a regression would cause an outage, and
prefer a new row in an existing table over a new file.

To run one test file, load the same loader as `pnpm test` does:
`node --import ./test/register.ts --test test/bots.test.ts`.

When the bot check learns a new pattern, add the user agent to `test/bots.test.ts`, and add a
browser or streaming tool's user agent there too if a change could block one. A false positive
blanks an overlay.

## Rules for changes

- Run `pnpm check` before pushing. CI additionally runs `biome ci` and a production build.
- Code style is set by Biome: four spaces (two in JSON files), 100 columns. Commit messages follow
  `type(scope): summary` (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`).
- **Adding a service, a third-party host or anything stored in the browser changes the privacy
  policy.** So does a change to what the relay holds, what the gateway caches or what is counted
  or logged. Update `src/routes/privacy.tsx` and `src/routes/datenschutz.tsx` in the same change,
  and the list of services they show in `src/components/legal/OverlayServices.tsx`. The cases are
  listed in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#legal-pages).
- Keep fonts, scripts and images self-hosted. The pages set no cookies and run no analytics of
  visitors. The only thing stored in the browser is the theme choice.
- Chat messages and the names of chat users never go into a log, a counter, KV or the storage of
  the Durable Object.
- Do not write dark styles by hand. Change the light tokens in `src/brand.css`; Dark Reader
  derives the night version from them.
- `src/worker` runs in the Workers runtime and is type-checked on its own, against that runtime's
  types and without the DOM library. Code outside it must not import from it.
- What the start page says lives in `src/lib/seo/site.ts`. See [SEO.md](SEO.md) before changing it.
- Overlay addresses live in streamers' OBS scenes. The overlay stays at `/chat/<channel>`, and an
  option of the link is never removed or given another meaning once it has shipped.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs dependencies with the frozen lockfile, then runs typecheck,
`biome ci`, the tests and a build. It runs for pushes and pull requests to `main`, and on demand.
All runs use GitHub-hosted runners; no local runner is needed.
Actions are pinned to commits. Renovate keeps dependencies and those pins current.

Cloudflare Workers Builds deploys pushes to `main`. Its `pnpm build:cloudflare` command installs
the frozen lockfile and runs the same checks and build before deployment, independently of
GitHub Actions. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#releasing) and
[Protect main](DEPLOYMENT.md#10-protect-main).
